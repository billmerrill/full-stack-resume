    <h2>Introductory Letter</h2>
<p>
    My name is Bill Merrill, I am web developer with comprehensive experience delivering internet products.  I am applying for your Senior Front-End Web Developer position and would appreciate your consideration.
</p>

<p>
I started my career as the primary developer creating the HTML-based product interfaces for network security startup Arbor Networks.  Since then I have developed ad and analytics platforms for millions of European IPTV viewers at Zattoo, worked in a small team to create a publishing platform for Reuters, developed web-based educational materials for MySQL, and worked with many entrepreneurs to create web products to bring their ideas to fruition.
</p>

<p>
I began studying User Interaction at the University of Michigan; I wrote student-focused mapping and statistics software supporting the study of Learner Centered Design.  I now take a direct and practical approach to User Experience development.  My front-end focus is based in creating clear markup, logical styling, and safe javascript, and learning good tools to generate them.  Carefully considered and standards-based assets are the best first step towards creating accessible and indexable web pages; they respect the audience and focus on the goals of communication and interaction.  I enjoy working with both content experts and visual designers to bring ideas and designs to actualization.
</p>

<p>
In addition to my front-end experience, I am web application developer, I create both client and server rendered applications.  On the server I prefer Python and PHP, for client apps I use javascript module controller designs and have shipped products using the AngularJS framework.  I also develop and administer topophile.com, a website that combines GIS and 3D printing technology letting people build models of the places they love.
</p>

<p>
I believe considering how work is done is an important part of success and enjoy working on self-aware teams.  My years of working with multi-site organizations and as a remote consultant have taught me the importance of good communication hygiene.  The right amount of process and communication feed back into themselves and make successes and problems evident.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the LC III was my first Macintosh computer and I have used them as my primary computer ever since.  I’ve used several of the Omni Group’s products over the years and I’d be very pleased to support their sale and use.
