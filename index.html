        <h2>Introductory Letter</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Bill Merrill, I am web developer with comprehensive experience delivering internet products.  I am applying for your Senior Front-End Web Developer position and would appreciate your consideration.
        </p>

        <p>
        I started my career as the primary developer creating the HTML-based product interfaces for network security startup Arbor Networks.  Since then I have developed ad and analytics platforms for millions of European IPTV viewers at Zattoo, worked in a small team to create a publishing platform for Reuters, developed web-based educational materials for MySQL, and worked with many entrepreneurs to create web products to bring their ideas to fruition.
        </p>

        <p>
        I began studying User Interaction at the University of Michigan; I wrote student-focused mapping and statistics software supporting the study of Learner Centered Design.  I now take a direct and practical approach to User Experience development.  My front-end focus is based in creating clear markup, logical styling, and safe javascript, and learning good tools to generate them.  Carefully considered and standards-based assets are the best first step towards creating accessible and indexable web pages; they respect the audience and focus on the goals of communication and interaction.  I enjoy working with both content experts and visual designers to bring ideas and designs to actualization.
        </p>

        <p>
        In addition to my front-end experience, I am web application developer, I create both client and server rendered applications.  On the server I prefer Python and PHP, for client apps I use javascript module controller designs and have shipped products using the AngularJS framework.  I also develop and administer topophile.com, a website that combines GIS and 3D printing technology letting people build models of the places they love.
        </p>

        <p>
        I believe considering how work is done is an important part of success and enjoy working on self-aware teams.  My years of working with multi-site organizations and as a remote consultant have taught me the importance of good communication hygiene.  The right amount of process and communication feed back into themselves and make successes and problems evident.
        </p>

        <p>
        Lastly, the LC III was my first Macintosh computer and I have used them as my primary computer ever since.  I’ve used several of the Omni Group’s products over the years and I’d be very pleased to support their sale and use.
        </p>

        <h3>Topophile</h3>
        <a href="http://topophile.com">website</a>
        <a href="http://topophile.com">
            <img src="assets/topophile.png" alt="Topophile's Model Builder">
        </a>

        <p>
            Topophile is a hobby business I’ve created to explore geographical data and geo-programming.  The website gives a person familiar with online tools like MapQuest or Google Maps tools to 3D print custom models of the Earth’s surface.  I am responsible for both the front and backend of the website and I’ll take this opportunity to talk about a couple points in the front-end.
        </p>

        <p>
            The landing page, the first thing most users will see, was the last thing I completed before the initial launch.  While the primary app did not work on mobile in 2014 (I’m now excited to see WebGL has become standard on iOS Safari and I look forward to improving the model builder for mobile) I did make sure the page was responsive and looked good on smart phone browsers.
        </p>

        <h1>
        [ INSERT Responsive Landing Page Image]
        [ Caption: Showing the Topophile landing page in desktop and smartphone views ]
    </h1>

        <p>
            The model builder has three steps, the first is exploring terrain.  Rather than attempt a VR-like experience, I strove to use a familiar tiled web map and show the terrain related to selected areas.  On the left a person searches for a feature and selects an area on the map, on the right a low-resolution model of the terrain is quickly displayed.  I wanted clarity and speed for this step as users spend some time perfecting their selection.
        </p>

        <h1>
            [ INSERT Terrain search Image]
        [Caption: Animation, the process of searching and refining terrain for a model]
    </h1>

        <p>
            I found communicating the size of printed model to be very important as people decided to purchase.  I started by selecting three standard sizes for a model and displayed the height, width, and depth of a model textually. Going further I wanted to show an object a person might have handy for comparison.  I chose a US dollar bill and a Euro note and added them to the 3D scene.  I hoped that seeing a object the could hold in real life might help them image the size of a plastic printed model.
        </p>

        <p>
            In testing, I found people were reluctant to click the buttons. They thought the buttons were related to the purchase price rather than the size of the model.  The next time I work on this element I will seek better solutions.
        </p>

        <h1>[INSERT Size Compare Image]
        [Caption: Animation, comparing different size models with real world objects]
    </h1>

        <p>
            I made a simple and I think beautiful clock animation using CSS to show the steps of unknowable duration that lead from a person designing a model to being able to purchase it from my 3D printing vendor.  While functionally no different than a spinner, I liked the visual representation of the steps setting up expectations and letting you know something’s still happening.
        </p>

        <h3>LaunchPad Central Video Classroom</h3>
        <p>
        I created these wireframes in response to the first discussion of a video classroom for Launchpad Central.  In the discussion we identified primary users and their goals.  We had lots of ideas of what could happen, and some discussion of a minimum interface.  These diagrams were more specific than our discussions and helped ground our questions about specific capabilities.  I have used Omnigraffle for wireframing for most of my career, it is invaluable.
        </p>

        <p>
            The two primary interfaces were the student’s viewing page and the instructors completion report.  I include the two wireframes I created to start the discussion before developing the interface.
        </p>

        <p>
            I later implemented this front-end application using bootstrap and AngularJS backed by the Youtube API and our own use behavior tracking.

        <P>
        I created a custom HTML and PHP blog theme for the bicycle repair collective I helped form in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The website is intentionally simple as the groups membership is a constantly evolving volunteer corps.  Were I to re-implement this now I would include a responsive layout for mobile device users.

        <p>
            Phoned In is my attempt to create a sense of time and memory with my photos.  Built in 2005, I posted photos from my cameraphone and displayed them in a calendar-like format.  I wrote server software receiving MMS photos in Python and calendar grid display and backing database in PHP. The latest photos are always in the lower right and the past is back to the left.  I no longer post to Phoned In but still browse it.

        <h1>
            [ INSERT image of incepted application ]
[ Caption: Image: incepted webpage ]
</h1>

<p>
I’ve composed this application as a HTML5 document.
</p>

<p>I starting writing prose in Pages to take advantage of the standard writing tools like spelling and grammar checking.  I made notes of images and animations I’d like to include and put placeholders in the prose.
</p>

<p>Then I created a source control repository for the project and added a blank html file and a directory for media assets.  I edited the html file using the Atom code editor and filled out a skeleton of tags with the basic structure of 3 sections, the Introduction, the Résumé, and the Example works.  Later I pasted sections of prose into the skeleton, linked images and animations, and made simple style adjustments.
</p>
<p>
I used the built-in macOS tools to create screens shots of my websites and record videos for animations.  I edited my screen shots using Preview.app and Acorn;  I used the command line tool ‘ffmpeg’ to convert the videos to animated gifs.
</p>

<p>
During the creation of this document I hosted all the assets on a local apache2 httpd instance.  I enjoy maintaining local development environments with few external dependencies, a habit from days of less-than-reliable network connectivity.
</p>

<p>As this is a simple document I’m not too worried about cross-browser display issues, but given the audience I’ve checked it in Omniweb, Safari, Chrome, Firefox on my Macbook Pro and Safari on my iPhone and iPad.
</p>

<p>I’ve also checked the webpage using an HTML5 validator.  I’ve not found it is economical to chase all the issues a validator might present, but they do often point out deficiencies that should be addressed such as illegally used tags or missing attributes.  Standards compliance goes a long way toward making an accessible document.  When working with Javascript I find jslint to be invaluable in a similar capacity.
